## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* NPM
* ESLint
* Webpack


## Description
_This is a project I created at Epicodus that tracks the number of cups of tea at Barry's Tea Shop.   The user is presented with a "Splash Page" and has the option to add a new tea. The user has the ability to add the name of the tea, blend, price, and cups they desire. Once the user has made their choices, they have the ability to update the tea, delete the tea, restock the tea, buy the tea, and lastly return to the tea list.  When the user has bought all the available tea the buy button will become inoperable.  Developing this application helped grow my understanding of JSX syntax._
